CVWO Final Submission Write-Up

Accomplishment
I have devoted my entire winter holiday as well as the first two school weeks on learning web development and building the to-do list app. As someone from a mathematical background, learning web development was more challenging for me compared to algorithms or mathematics. There is a large and diverse skill set we need to master in order to become a web developer. I did not even know basic HTML or linux command at the start. But I ploughed through, gaining an overview of the MVC web development framework and RESTful architecture. To my surprise, the greatest take-away for me from this assignment was not any specific web development skill, but the interest and perseverance in programming: to learn CS in the hard way, to read the documentation, to sit down and figure out the nitty-gritty details, but enjoy the sense of fulfillment of creating actual products that might benefit the community. Apart from the steep learning curve, the toughest obstacle I have encountered throughout the course of the assignment was learning how to stay calm during seemingly fruitless debugging. Debugging can be frustrating, but I have gained much patience and experience facing unknown bugs during this project. I believe this could be greatly helpful in my future CS career.
